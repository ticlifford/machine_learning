### 00_MNIST_classifier
machine learning helloworld in tensorflow. This is just me directly following udacity's 'Tensorflow for Deep learning' tutorial to get a gist for it, and it's here mostly for my own reference. I applied a neural network with 128 dense layers which is the value they give for their fashion_mnist application. I needed to remove the magic function from the google colab file because it wasn't running in my jupyter notebook.
